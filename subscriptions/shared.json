This one, titled <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/1037.short\">Graduate Students' Teaching Experiences Improve Their Methodological Research Skills</a>, is another paper whose basic premise I generally agree with-- they found that graduate students who had teaching responsibilities as well as research responsibilities did a better job of writing research proposals than graduate students who only did research. From all appearances, it's a good study, and makes a valuable point.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, I have a hard time not mocking a paper that includes the following data graph:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://scienceblogs.com/principles/upload/2011/08/do_you_really_need_a_graph_for/teaching_research_silly_graph.png\" width=\"453\" height=\"371\" alt=\"teaching_research_silly_graph.png\"></p>\n\n<p>I mean, really? You have two data points with error bars. does this really need to be presented as a graph? Let alone one playing \"How to Lie With Statistics\" games with the axis limits?</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn't a table be just as effective? In the space taken up by the two basically identical graphs of this form, you could've put a single table with <em>all</em> of your data, not just data on two selected subcategories of your evaluation. You could even have included a table with a detailed statistical breakdown in a convenient easy-to-read format, rather than scattering the results through the text.</p>\n\n<p>But, I guess it isn't <cite>Science</cite>-worthy if it doesn't have a graph. Even an incredibly silly one.</p>\n\n\n <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/08/do_you_really_need_a_graph_for.php#commentsArea?utm_source=combinedfeed&amp;utm_medium=rss\">Read the comments on this post...</a><p style=\"margin-top:20px;padding-top:5px;border-top:1px solid #ccc\">\nAlso check out the featured ScienceBlog of the week: <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/bookclub/?utm_source=rssTextLink\"><em>Inside the Outbreaks</em> on the ScienceBlogs Book Club</a>\n</p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/f2sgjk82ei57q75m9gnn6hiau0/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fprinciples%2F2011%2F08%2Fdo_you_really_need_a_graph_for.php%3Futm_source%3Dcombinedfeed%26utm_medium%3Drss\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScienceblogsCombinedFeed/~4/BGkD_wPVqDs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"
